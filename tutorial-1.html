                      <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                  <li><p><b>Python is Interpreted:</b> Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Python is Interactive:</b> You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Python is Object-Oriented:</b> Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Python is a Beginner's Language:</b> Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>History of Python</h2>
                  <p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>
                  <p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>
                  <p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
                  <p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>
                  <h2>Python Features</h2>
                  <p>Python's features include:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                  <li><p><b>Easy-to-learn:</b> Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Easy-to-read:</b> Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Easy-to-maintain:</b> Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>A broad standard library:</b> Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Interactive Mode:</b>Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Portable:</b> Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Extendable:</b> You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Databases:</b> Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>GUI Programming:</b> Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</p></li>
                  <li><p><b>Scalable:</b> Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                  <li><p>IT supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</p></li>
                  <li><p>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</p></li>
                  <li><p>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</p></li>
                  <li><p>IT supports automatic garbage collection.</p></li>
                  <li><p>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <a name="Installation" class=""></a>
                  <h1>2.Installation</h1>
                  <div>
<p>Python 3 is available on for Windows, Mac OS and most of the flavours of Linux operating system. Even though Python 2 is available for many other OSs, Python 3 support either has not been made available for them or has been dropped.</p>
<h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>
<p>Open a terminal window and type "python" to find out if it is already installed and which version is installed.</p>

<h2>Getting Python</h2>
<p><b>Windows platform</b></p>
<p>Binaries of latest version of Python 3 (Python 3.5.1) are available on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank">this download page</a></p>
<p>Following different installation options are available</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows x86-64 embeddable zip file</li>
<li>Windows x86-64 executable installer</li>
<li>Windows x86-64 web-based installer</li>
<li>Windows x86 embeddable zip file</li>
<li>Windows x86 executable installer</li>
<li>Windows x86 web-based installer</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b>In order to install Python 3.5.1, minimum OS requirements are Windows 7 with SP1. For versions 3.0 to 3.4.x Windows XP is aceeptable.</p>
<p><b>Linux platform</b></p>
<p>Different flavours of Linux use different package managers for installation of new packages.</p>
<p>On Ubuntu Linux Python 3 is installed using following command from terminal</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$sudo apt-get install python3-minimal
</pre>
<p>Installation from source</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Download Gzipped source tarball from Python's download URL : <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz</a>
Extract the tarball
tar xvfz Python-3.5.1.tgz
Configure and Install:
cd Python-3.5.1
./configure --prefix=/opt/python3.5.1
make  
sudo make install
</pre>

<h2>Setting up PATH</h2>
<p>Programs and other executable files can be in many directories, so operating systems provide a search path that lists the directories that the OS searches for executables.</p>
<p>The path is stored in an environment variable, which is a named string maintained by the operating system. This variable contains information available to the command shell and other programs.</p>
<p>The <b>path</b> variable is named as PATH in Unix or Path in Windows (Unix is case-sensitive; Windows is not).</p>
<p>In Mac OS, the installer handles the path details. To invoke the Python interpreter from any particular directory, you must add the Python directory to your path.</p>
<h2>Setting path at Unix/Linux</h2>
<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Unix:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>In the csh shell:</b> type setenv PATH "$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p></li>
<li><p><b>In the bash shell (Linux):</b> type export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/bin/python3.4 and press Enter.</p></li>
<li><p><b>In the sh or ksh shell:</b> type PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> /usr/local/bin/python3 is the path of the Python directory </p>
<h2>Setting path at Windows</h2>
<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Windows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>At the command prompt :</b> type <br />path %path%;C:\Python and press Enter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> C:\Python is the path of the Python directory </p>
<h2>Python Environment Variables</h2>
<p>Here are important environment variables, which can be recognized by Python:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>PYTHONPATH</td><td>It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PYTHONSTARTUP </td><td>It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PYTHONCASEOK</td><td>It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PYTHONHOME</td><td>It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Running Python</h2>
<p>There are three different ways to start Python:</p>
<h2>(1) Interactive Interpreter:</h2>
<p>You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.</p>
<p>Enter <b>python</b> the command line.</p>
<p>Start coding right away in the interactive interpreter.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$python             # Unix/Linux

or 

python%             # Unix/Linux

or 

C:&gt;python           # Windows/DOS
</pre>
<p>Here is the list of all the available command line options:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>Option</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>-d</td><td>provide debug output</td></tr>
<tr><td>-O</td><td>generate optimized bytecode (resulting in .pyo files)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-S</td><td>do not run import site to look for Python paths on startup</td></tr>
<tr><td>-v</td><td>verbose output (detailed trace on import statements)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-X</td><td>disable class-based built-in exceptions (just use strings); obsolete starting with version 1.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>-c cmd</td><td>run Python script sent in as cmd string</td></tr>
<tr><td>file</td><td>run Python script from given file</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>(2) Script from the Command-line:</h2>
<p>A Python script can be executed at command line by invoking the interpreter on your application, as in the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$python  script.py          # Unix/Linux

or 

python% script.py           # Unix/Linux

or 

C:&gt;python script.py         # Windows/DOS
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure the file permission mode allows execution.</p>
<h2>(3) Integrated Development Environment</h2>
<p>You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Unix:</b> IDLE is the very first Unix IDE for Python.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Windows:</b> PythonWin is the first Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Macintosh:</b> The Macintosh version of Python  along with the IDLE IDE is available from the main website, downloadable as either MacBinary or BinHex'd files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to set up the environment properly, then you can take help from your system admin. Make sure the Python environment is properly set up and working perfectly fine.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> All the examples given in subsequent chapters are executed with Python 3.4.1 version available on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux</p>
<p>We already have set up Python Programming environment online, so that you can execute all the available examples online at the same time when you are learning theory. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.</p>

  <a href="" name="Datatypes"></a>
  <h1>3.Data Types</h1>
  <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
<p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
<h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>
<p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
<p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python

counter = 100          # An integer assignment
miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
name    = "John"       # A string

print counter
print miles
print name
</pre>
<p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and  "John" are the values assigned to <i>counter</i>, <i>miles</i>, and <i>name</i> variables, respectively. This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
100
1000.0
John
</pre>
<h2>Multiple Assignment</h2>
<p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
a = b = c = 1
</pre>
<p>Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all three variables are assigned to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
  a, b, c = 1, 2, "john"
</pre>
<p>Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to variables a and b respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.</p>
<h2>Standard Data Types</h2>
<p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>
<p>Python has five standard data types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Numbers</p></li>
<li><p>String</p></li>
<li><p>List</p></li>
<li><p>Tuple</p></li>
<li><p>Dictionary</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Numbers</h2>
<p>Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var1 = 1
var2 = 10
</pre>
<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement. The syntax of the del statement is &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]
</pre>
<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
del var
del var_a, var_b
</pre>
<p>Python supports four different numerical types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>int (signed integers)</p></li>
<li><p>long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal)</p></li>
<li><p>float (floating point real values)</p></li>
<li><p>complex (complex numbers)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of numbers &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>int</th><th>long</th><th>float</th><th>complex</th></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>51924361L</td><td>0.0</td><td>3.14j</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>-0x19323L</td><td>15.20</td><td>45.j</td></tr>
<tr><td>-786</td><td>0122L</td><td>-21.9</td><td>9.322e-36j</td></tr>
<tr><td>080</td><td>0xDEFABCECBDAECBFBAEl</td><td>32.3+e18</td><td>.876j</td></tr>
<tr><td>-0490</td><td>535633629843L</td><td>-90.</td><td>-.6545+0J</td></tr>
<tr><td>-0x260</td><td>-052318172735L</td><td>-32.54e100</td><td>3e+26J</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x69</td><td>-4721885298529L</td><td>70.2-E12</td><td>4.53e-7j</td></tr>
</table>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Python allows you to use a lowercase l with long, but it is recommended that you use only an uppercase L to avoid confusion with the number 1. Python displays long integers with an uppercase L.</p></li>
<li><p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x + yj, where x and y are the real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Strings</h2>
<p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.</p>
<p>The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python

str = 'Hello World!'

print str          # Prints complete string
print str[0]       # Prints first character of the string
print str[2:5]     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print str[2:]      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print str * 2      # Prints string two times
print str + "TEST" # Prints concatenated string
</pre>
<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello World!
H
llo
llo World!
Hello World!Hello World!
Hello World!TEST
</pre>
<h2>Python Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.</p>
<p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python

list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

print list          # Prints complete list
print list[0]       # Prints first element of the list
print list[1:3]     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print list[2:]      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print tinylist * 2  # Prints list two times
print list + tinylist # Prints concatenated lists
</pre>
<p>This produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003]
abcd
[786, 2.23]
[2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003]
[123, 'john', 123, 'john']
['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'john']
</pre>
<h2>Python Tuples</h2>
<p>A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.</p>
<p>The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as <b>read-only</b> lists. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python

tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
tinytuple = (123, 'john')

print tuple           # Prints complete list
print tuple[0]        # Prints first element of the list
print tuple[1:3]      # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print tuple[2:]       # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print tinytuple * 2   # Prints list two times
print tuple + tinytuple # Prints concatenated lists
</pre>
<p>This produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003)
abcd
(786, 2.23)
(2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003)
(123, 'john', 123, 'john')
('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'john')
</pre>
<p>The following code is invalid with tuple, because we attempted to update a tuple, which is not allowed. Similar case is possible with lists &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python

tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  ]
tuple[2] = 1000    # Invalid syntax with tuple
list[2] = 1000     # Valid syntax with list
</pre>
<h2>Python Dictionary</h2>
<p>Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]). For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python

dict = {}
dict['one'] = "This is one"
dict[2]     = "This is two"

tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}


print dict['one']       # Prints value for 'one' key
print dict[2]           # Prints value for 2 key
print tinydict          # Prints complete dictionary
print tinydict.keys()   # Prints all the keys
print tinydict.values() # Prints all the values
</pre>
<p>This produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is one
This is two
{'dept': 'sales', 'code': 6734, 'name': 'john'}
['dept', 'code', 'name']

<h2>Data Type Conversion</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you may need to perform conversions between the built-in types. To convert between types, you simply use the type name as a function.</p>
<p>There are several built-in functions to perform conversion from one data type to another. These functions return a new object representing the converted value.</p>

<h1>4.Operators</h1>
  <p>Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.</p>
<p>Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.</p>
<h2>Types of Operator</h2>
<p>Python language supports the following types of operators.</p>

  <h4>Conditional Statements</h4>


  <p>Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.</p>
<p>Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.</p>
<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/decision_making.jpg" alt="Decision making statements in Python" />
<p>Python programming language assumes any <b>non-zero</b> and <b>non-null</b> values as TRUE, and if it is either <b>zero</b> or <b>null</b>, then it is assumed as FALSE value.</p>
<p>Python programming language provides following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th style="width:35%">Statement</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><p>if statements</p></td><td>An <b>if statement</b> consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</td></tr>

<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement &minus;</p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th style="width:30%">Control Statement</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><p>break statement<s/p></td>
<td>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>continue statement</p></td>
<td>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>pass statement</p></td>
<td>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</td></tr>
